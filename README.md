Implementing a Stateful Network Protocol: 
This assignment will require you to write an implementation of a server for a very simple stateful network protocol. You will implement both the server and the client, and they will be expected both to speak the protocol correctly to each other as well as to speak the protocol correctly with our own reference implementation.

WAR: A Card game

Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft is a cross-platform online card game with "war" in the title. No matter whether using a Mac, PC, iOS, or Android device, anyone can play the game with anyone else. The original card game war, however, is much simpler than that game (although probably not more popular). For this assignment, we will be programming a cross-platform implementation of the "war" card game server. If you implement the protocol correctly, your code will be able to communicate with any other students code regardless of the choice of language.

WAR: The simplified rules

The simplified rules for our version of war are as follows: the dealer (server) deals half of the deck, at random, to the two players (clients). Each player "turns over" (sends) one of their cards to the server, and the server responds to each player "win" "lose" or "draw." Unlike normal war (as this class is about network programming not video game programming), in the event of a tie neither player receives a "point" and play simply moves on to the next round. After all of the cards have been used, play stops and each client knows (based on the number of points they received) whether they won or they lost. Once each player has received the results of 26 rounds, they disconnect.

WAR: The message format

All WAR game messages follow the WAR message format. Each type of message has a fixed size, but not all messages are the same size. Each message consist of a one byte "command" followed by either a one byte payload or a 26 byte payload. The command values map as such:

commandvalue
want game    0
game start   1
play card    2
play result  3
For want game, play card, and play result, the payload is one byte long. For the "want game" message, the "result" should always be the value 0.

For the "game start" message (where the payload is a set of 26 cards), the payload is 26 bytes representing 26 cards. The byte representation of cards are a mapping between each of the 52 cards in a standard deck to the integers [0..51]. Mapping cards follows the suit order clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades, and within each suit, the rank order by value (i.e. 2, 3, 4,  , 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace). Thus, 0, 1, and 2 map onto 2 of Clubs, 3 of Clubs, 4 of Clubs; 11, 12, 13, and 14 map onto the King of Clubs, the Ace of Clubs, the 2 of Diamonds, and the 3 of Diamonds; and finally 49, 50, and 51 map onto the Queen, King, and Ace of Spades. Note that you cannot compare card values directly to determine the winner of a "war" - youll need to write a custom comparison function which maps two different card values onto win, lose, or draw.

When sending a "game start" message, the server sends half of the deck, at random, to each player by sending 26 bytes with the values [0..51] to one player and the remaining 26 to the other player.

When sending a "play card" message, the client sends one byte which represents one of their cards. Which card to send is undefined, but you cannot send the same card twice within the same game.

Within a "play result" message, the one byte payload values map as such:

resultvalue
win0
draw1
lose2
WAR: the network protocol

Parallel to the simplified rules, the WAR protocol is as follows. A war server listens for new TCP connections on a given port. It waits until two clients have connected to that port. Once both have connected, the clients send a message containing the "want game" command. If both clients do this correctly, the server responds with a message containing the "game start" command, with a payload containing the list of cards dealt to that client.

After each client has received their half of the deck, the clients send messages including the "play card" message, and set the payload to their chosen card. After the server has received a "play card" message from both clients, it will respond with a "play result" message to both clients, telling each one whether they won or lost. This process continues until each player has sent all of their cards and received all of their play results; after receiving the last play result, the clients disconnect; after sending the last play result, the server also disconnects.

For War v.1, your server and client only need to play one game, and then exit.

Template

For this homework, I wrote a solution using well-factored code, and we will provide that code with docstrings and call signatures, but no function bodies. Your job is to complete an implementation of the server program. You are not required to use the functions as declared in the skeleton, but I think its a good idea.

Provided client

The provided python program also implements a client, using the built in python event loop. This client can be run one at a time, so that you could e.g. run two terminals that each run python war.py client 127.0.0.1 4444, and as long as you have a server listening on 127.0.0.1:4444, each client will connect and play a game of war. Upon correct operation, the provided client outputs literally nothing. It does, however, have several log messages in the source.

The built in event loop is a new feature introduced in Python 3.5, which enables event driven coding without having to write callbacks or use any extra libraries. This allows writing code in a synchronous style that all runs within one thread. If you have questions about how this code works, please ask on Piazza. Again, throwing debug statements in that code is a great idea.

The provided client will run one client with the argument client. It can also run an arbitrary number of clients with the first argument clients, and an additional argument that is the number of clients to run. You can use this to stress test your implementation, for instance by launching 1000 clients with the command python war.py clients 127.0.0.1 444 1000.

The provided example_play.pcap shows the correct run of a single full game played with a correctly functioning server.

The provided laggy.py has the same functionality as war.py, except that before sending every card, it waits for 1 second. Code which can play multiple games simultaneously are expected to be able to complete full speed war.py clients while several laggy.py clients are slowly playing their own games on the same server.
